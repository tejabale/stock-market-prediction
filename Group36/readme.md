# Stock Market Prediction

### Course project for CS337, IITB

The goal of this project is to perform stock price prediction using deep learning techniques. A stock price is a sequential data and thus a simple feed-forward network may not be appropriate foir this task. We will need to use models that operate with input data that acts as a sequence. Hence, **RNNs** and its variants are used.

To run the code, directly open the colab notebook and run it. There is an *.ipynb file* and everything including data extraction can be done using it. We have also added code.py file which consists of the same code.
